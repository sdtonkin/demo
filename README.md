#Communication Rules
1. Expect Daily Check-ins – Be prepared.
2. Update tasks prior to meeting
3. Stick to the check-in topics
4. What did you accomplish since last check-in?
5. What are plan on accomplishing between now and next check-in?
6. Do you have any roadblocks?
7. Do you need assistance with any of your tasks?
8. Add meaningful comments in source control – be specific about the files you touched.
9. If you need to skip a check-in meeting, please provide update via email.


#Development Rules
1. Structure your estimates
    Example of an 8 hour task:
        How time goes to coding?: 4 hours
        How much time goes to testing?: 1 hour
        How much time goes to bug fixing?: 2 hour
        How much time for a buffer?: 1 hour
    If you use up all of your coding time (4 hours in the example above) and your not done yet, raise a red flag.  Contact the tech lead or the arch for assistance.  
2. Commit your changes on the completion of each task.  Adding reference to task in the comments is preferred.
3. Changes made to the solution should only be executed through the deployment mechanism.  Do not make manual changes to the Test or Production environment.
4. Get confirmation before starting a task.  Some tasks may have dependencies.

#SharePoint Best Practices
1. Always use PnP for data operations.
2. Use web part titles when possible.  Avoid embedding the title of a component within JavaScript code.
